# Online-second-hand-store
In this project, we aim to build a website to facilitate our fellow students in NITK in buying and selling second hand goods. In order to accomplish this, we made use of multiple technologies.  We have used PHP for backend, MySQL as a database, HTML for structure designing, CSS for web page formatting and  Javascript for form validation and animations.
